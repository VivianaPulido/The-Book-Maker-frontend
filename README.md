# The Book Maker
This is my 3rd module project for the Ironhack Bootcamp.
It is a website for a bussiness that offers book printing on demand, staring from a single copy.
It currently features a home, a price calculator and a user profile where you can see your created books(for ordering), edit them and delete them.

The features to be added soon are the shopping cart and all ecommerce functionalities.
