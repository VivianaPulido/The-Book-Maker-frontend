# The Book Maker
This is a simple web application created as a project for a bootcamp.
The concept is for a bussiness that offers the printing of books(of your authorship) on demand, staring from a single copy.
It currently features a home, a price calculator and a user profile where you can see your created books(for ordering), edit them and delete them.

The features to be added soon are the shopping cart and all ecommerce functionalities.
