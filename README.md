# The Book Maker
This is my 3rd module project for the Ironhack Bootcamp.
It is a website for a bussiness that offers book printing on demand, staring from a single copy.<br/>
It currently features a home, a price calculator where you can also create a book to print, and a user profile where you can see your created books, edit them and delete them.

The features to be added soon are the shopping cart and all ecommerce functionalities.
